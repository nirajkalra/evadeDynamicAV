### ℹ️ IMPORTANT: 
This repository is being used for carrying out improved implementation of malWASH technique whcih has been proposed to be used for evading dynamic analysis antivirus.
#               :mag: FULLY UNDETECTABLE MALWARE ARCHITECTURE (FUMA)
## Introduction:  
Dynamic analysis observes a malicious behavior during the execution of sample code. MalWASH has been proposed as one such recent techniue for dynamic evasion. 
malWASH is a dynamic diversification engine that executes an arbitrary program without being detected by dynamic analysis tools.
mamlWASH is a research project which is based on the principle of hiding the behaviour of malicious program by distributing programs execution across many benign processes on the system. It involves breaking the original binary into small chunks where individual chunk executes few system calls as it contains limited functionality. 

## Scope of project 
The scope of this project will be to find limitaions of the original research project of malWASH version claimed to be unstable as of now and thereafter, recommend proposal and improve the implementations to overcome the selected shortfalls. This repository is primarily being used for the verion control of the implementation part.
