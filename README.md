ℹ️ IMPORTANT: This repository is being used for carrying out improved implementation of malWASH technique used for dynamic analysis antivirus evasion

Introduction:  Dynamic analysis observes a malicious behavior during the execution of sample code. MalWASH has been proposed as one such recent techniue for dynamic evasion. This tool is based on the principle of hiding the behaviour of malicious program by distributing programs execution across many benign processes on the system. It involves breaking the original binary into small chunks where individual chunk executes few system calls as it contains limited functionality. 

The scope of this project will be to find limitaions of the malWASH technique and proposals to overcome them. This repository will be used for the verion control of the implementation part.
